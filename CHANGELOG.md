# Changelog

All notable changes to td are documented in this file.

## [v0.41.0] - 2026-03-01

### Bug Fixes
- Fix premature title truncation in task list panel: overhead calculation in `formatIssueShort` was overestimating by 3 chars due to phantom leading spaces in tag width and a hardcoded type icon width. Task titles now display 3 more characters before truncating, giving more readable output in both `td monitor` and sidecar's embedded td view (sidecar#215)

## [v0.40.0] - 2026-02-27

### Features
- Add search/filter to help modal (press `/` to filter) (#25)
- Add scroll support to form modal
- Add `balanced_review_policy` feature flag (default on)
  - Allows creator-only approvals when a different session implemented the issue
  - Requires `--reason` for creator-exception approvals and logs them to security audit
  - Keeps implementer/self-approval blocked for non-minor issues

### Improvements
- Align `reviewable`/`in-review`/`status` reviewability hints with actual policy check

### Documentation
- Document balanced review policy in core workflow and references

  - Port file management and session bootstrap

### Fixes
- Support full agent file family (GEMINI.md, CLAUDE.local.md, etc) (#49)
